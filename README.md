- 👋 Hi, I’m @researchergabrieltoledo
- 👀 I’m interested in scientific research, particularly in solid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in electronics, physical optics, and chaotic systems modeling.
- 💼 I’m actively seeking an internship in engineering, data science, research, or related fields. I’m eager to learn more about programming and to develop both hard and soft skills through hands-on experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python, FORTRAN, MATLAB, and complex system simulations, especially in the fields of astrophysics, geophysics, and engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-de-toledo-paula-261a73212), [Email](mailto:gabrieldetoledopaula280703@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m fascinated by how simple physical systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, leading to complex and beautiful patterns in nature.
- 🥊 Sports: I practice Muay Thai and bodybuilding to maintain both physical and mental strength.
