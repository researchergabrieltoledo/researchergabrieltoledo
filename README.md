- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @researchergabrieltoledo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in scientific research, particularly in solid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational simulations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in electronics, physical optics, and chaotic systems modeling.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python, FORTRAN, MATLAB, and complex system simulations, especially in the fields of astrophysics, geophysics, and engineering.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-de-toledo-paula-261a73212), [Email](mailto:gabrieldetoledopaula280703@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m fascinated by how simple physical systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, leading to complex and beautiful patterns in nature.
- ðŸ¥Š Sports: I practice Muay Thai and bodybuilding to maintain both physical and mental strength.
